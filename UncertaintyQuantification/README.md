# Uncertainty Quantification

* `+PolynomialChaos` — polynomial chaos expansions for Hermite, Jacobi, and
  Legendre polynomial bases.
* `+StochasticCollocation` — stochastic collocation techniques based on
  [Interpolation](https://github.com/MathRocks/Approximation).
* `@KarhunenLoeve` — a class for the Karhunen–Loève decomposition.
* `@MonteCarlo` — a class for Monte Carlo sampling.
* `PolynomialChaos` — the entry point for `+PolynomialChaos`.
* `StochasticCollocation` — the entry point for `+StochasticCollocation`.
